Feiyue Xia is a Ph.D student of petroleum engineering at [UT austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) from August 2022, working with Professor [Carlos Torres-Verdin](https://pge.utexas.edu/facultystaff/faculty-directory/torres-verdin). Previously he did Master degree, majoring in Borehole Geophysics, at China University of Petroleum (East China), where he worked with Professor [Xiao-Ming Tang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiao-Ming-Tang-2). He got the B.E in Exploration Technology and Engineering from China University of Petroleum (East China).

His research interest lies in acoustic logging especially borehole geophysical numerical and analytical modelling. He is skilled in 3D or 2.5D FDTD ealstic wave modelling of complex media, such as elastic media, poro-elastic media and cracked porous elastic media. He used to be invited to join [IPTC Educational Week](https://www.iptcnet.org/19iptc/education-activities/education-week/) and also obtained [SPWLA Scholarship](https://www.spwla.org/SPWLA/Foundation/Grants_and_Scholarship_Recipients/SPWLA/Foundation/Grants_and_Scholarship_Recipients.aspx?hkey=9d374860-c03f-42eb-8108-c6d638f8a4ff) in 2019 when he was an undergraduate.
